- There are two main variants:`waterfall` and `iterative`.
## Waterfall Methodology
- Also known as the`sequential`methodology.
- Consists of simple steps that should be accomplished:
	**feasibility study** =>  **requirements** =>  **architecture** =>  **design** => **development** =>  **testing** =>  **deployment** =>  **operation**.
	Another Variation of step names:
	**proposal** => **analysis** => **business requirement definition** => **technical architecture** => **functional design** => **technical design** => **unit testing** => **system testing** => **integration testing** => **user acceptance testing** => **rollout** => **implementation** => **maintenance** => **support**.
- The testing period is the riskiest time.
## Iterative Methodology
- Also known as the`spiral`or`incremental`methodology.
- releasing the same version several times to the target user. The Dwh pieces are built in parallell.
- The main principle of iterative methodology is to release bigger portion of the project to discover problems early.
- The main reason for doing the project this way is to minimize the risks.
